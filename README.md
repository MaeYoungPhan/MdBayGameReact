# The Maryland Bay Game

*The Official Chesapeake Bay Activity App for Fun From the Bridge to the Beach*

## Application Overview

Each year, thousands flock to Maryland‚Äôs eastern shore for vacation. The route from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to the beach is scenic ‚Ä¶ and long. In the days before smartphones and tablets, the Maryland Bay Game, an activity book featuring games and trivia about the Chesapeake Bay watershed, was the answer to road trip boredom. The book was handed out at the toll booths, courtesy of the State of Maryland.
The game lasted several years in the late 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs, before falling into oblivion. 

## Purpose

By re-creating key features of the original Maryland Bay Game, The Maryland Bay Game web application enables new generations of Maryland beach-goers to experience the fun and become lifelong protectors of one of America's most unique natural treasures.

The server is available [here](https://github.com/MaeYoungPhan/md-bay-game-server). This app was initially built in two weeks as a final project for my full-stack web dev program.

### The Original Maryland Bay Game

Adapting the Bay Game for web use for me has been recreating a memory. I hope 90‚Äôs kids, especially those who grew up in DelMarVa, will find it awesomely nostalgic. To sum it up, it‚Äôs a whole vibe. As such, I tried to stay true to the OG 1997 activity book as much as possible. Here are some excerpts from that booklet for reference. (This explanation is also a little bit so you‚Äôre not like, ‚ÄúWTF. Is this comic sans?!‚Äù when you clone this masterpiece.)
